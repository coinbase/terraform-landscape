        The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,

        To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
        changes, it is recommended to add version = "..." constraints to the
        corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings
        suggested below.

        Terraform has been successfully initialized!

        You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
        any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
        should now work.

        If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
        rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
        commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

        No changes. Infrastructure is up-to-date.

        This means that Terraform did not detect any differences between your
